```{python}
#| echo: false
import nbdev.showdoc as sd
from pprint import pprint
```
# Part 1

* Read in input file contain list of moves
* each line contains 2 pairs: 
    * the first column is the opponents move: Rock (A) Paper(B) Scissors(C)
    * the second column is your move Rock (X) Paper(Y) Scissors (Z) 

```{python}
with open("day2/input.txt") as f:
    input = f.read().splitlines()

pprint(input[:5])

```

```{python}
#| echo: false
from butchland_aoc2022.day2 import *

```


```{python}
#| echo: false
sd.show_doc(match_value)
```

```{python}
print(match_value("Rock","Paper"))
print(match_value("Rock","Scissors"))
print(match_value("Paper","Paper"))
print(match_value("Paper","Scissors"))

```

* Create a function that computes the score for each line

```{python}
#| echo: false
sd.show_doc(score)
```


* For each sequence of numbers punctuated by 
an empty line, sum up calories for each 
* If sum of calories is greater than current max, set that as the current max

```{python}

print(score("A Y"))
print(score("B X"))
print(score("C Z"))
```

* Finally the total score

```{python}
total_score = sum([score(l) for l in input])
print(f'the correct answer for part 1 is {total_score}')
```

## Part 2

* Reinterpret your move to follow a strategy: 
   - X means WIN, Y means DRAW, Z means LOSE
